Gallia est omnis dīvīsa in partēs trēs.  
Ūnam partem incolunt Belgae, aliam Aquītānī, tertiam ipsī Gallī.  
(Ipsōrum linguā Celtae, nostrā Gallī appellantur.)  
Hī omnēs linguā, īnstitūtīs, lēgibus inter sē differunt.  
Gallōs ab Aquītānīs Garumna flūmen, ā Belgīs Mātrona et Sēquana dīvidit.  

All Gaul is divided into three parts.  
The Belgians inhabit one part, the Aquitanians another, the Gauls themselves the third.  
(In their own language they are called Celts; in ours, Gauls.)  
These (tribes) all differ among themselves in language, institutions, and laws.  
The Garumna river divides the Gauls from the Aquitanians; the Marne and Seine, from the Belgians.

> Latin nouns have different forms that follow a grammatical pattern called gender.  This grammatical gender does not necessarily match biological gender; usually it is just arbitrary.  Most country names, like Gallia, are grammatically feminine.  Adjectives match the gender of their noun. The masculine form dīvīsus changed its ending to the feminine dīvīsa to match the gender of Gallia.

>When an adjective ends in -﻿us in the masculine, the feminine ends in -﻿a.  But when an adjective ends in -﻿is, the masculine and feminine forms are identical. Omnis is one of these adjectives; its masculine and feminine forms are the same.

>Latin has no words for "a" or "the," so we have to add them when translating Latin into English and drop them when translating English into Latin.
