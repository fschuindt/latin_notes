>In English, a native of ancient Gaul is called a Gaul.  In Latin, Gallia is the name of the country while Gallus is the general term for one of its people.  Gallus is also the specific term for a male Gaul. 

>Adjectives agree with their nouns in number as well as in gender.  In this next question, try to guess the plural form of bonus.

>The form of the verb incolit shows that the subject is not "I" or "you," but some third person.  English requires the subject to be mentioned, either by a noun or with a pronoun like "he," "she," or "it."  This is unnecessary in Latin.  Similarly, the form of incolunt shows that the subject is third person plural, whether or not the subject is actually mentioned.  No separate pronoun for "they" is needed because it is already implied by the verb ending.

>Latin often puts verbs at the end of the sentence, but any order of the subject, object, and verb is grammatically acceptable.  This is because the subject and object are usually differentiated by their form, not their position in the sentence. The forms you have learned so far are used for subjects and are called nominative case forms.  Partem is a form of pars.  It's used for objects and is called the accusative case form.  So, in the sentence, Gallī partem incolunt (The Gauls inhabit a part), Gallī is the subject and it is in nominative case, and partem is the object and it is in the accusative case.

>When the nominative singular ends in -﻿a, the accusative is formed by adding -﻿m.

>The Belgae were one of the tribes that inhabited the northern part of Gaul. Their name is unusual in having a feminine form but not a feminine meaning.  Belga refers to a Belgian man or woman; Belgae refers to Belgian men, women, or a group of both.
